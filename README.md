# Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to build a deep neural network that can recognize objects in photographs and to recognize new objects, without the need to retrain the network.

## Design


## Data
I will use CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 px colour images in 10 classes.
The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Algorithms
Feature Engineering
- Convert categorical features to binary dummy variables.

## Tools
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Keras, Pytorch and TensorFlow for modeling.
- Matplotlib for visualizations.

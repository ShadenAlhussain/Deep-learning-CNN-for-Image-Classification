# Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to build a deep neural network that can recognize objects in photographs and to recognize new objects, without the need to retrain the network.

## Design
Recognizing photos is one of the most common problems. I will build ML model that can classify images using CNN from CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 with the size of 32 by 32 pixels colour images in 10 classes. I will download CIFAR-10 datasets directly using Keras API. 

## Data
I will use CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 px colour images in 10 classes.
The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks, in which each of those classes consists of 6000 images.

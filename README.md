# Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to build a deep neural network that can recognize objects in photographs and to recognize new objects.

## Design
Recognizing photos is one of the most common problems. I will build machine learning model that can classify images using CNN from CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 with the size of 32 by 32 pixels colour images in 10 classes. I will use Keras API to download CIFAR-10 datasets.

## Data
I will use CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 pixels colour images in 10 classes.
The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks, in which each of those classes consists of 6000 images.
You can download the CIFAR-10 dataset using this link https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Algorithms
Feature Engineering
- Convert categorical features to binary variables.

## Tools
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Keras, Pytorch and TensorFlow for modeling.
- Matplotlib for visualizations.

# Project-Proposal

## Design
The goal of this project is to build a deep neural network that can recognize objects in photographs to build a deep neural network that can recognize objects in photographs and to recognize new objects, without the need to retrain the network.

## Data
I will use CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60000 32x32 px colour images in 10 classes.

## Algorithms

## Tools
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Keras, Pytorch and TensorFlow for modeling.
- Matplotlib for visualizations.
